### And now, a poem:
```
In the realm of digital dreams,
Where ideas flow like a lively stream,
A tool emerged with a clever scheme,
Crafting units from the coding seam.

Behold the wizard, the team picker,
With its magic, no need to bicker,
For it selects with a gentle flicker,
Assembling squads, each a beaming flicker.

Gathered together in a vibrant beam,
A fusion of talents, a dazzling gleam,
Bound by purpose, a shared regime,
In this world spun by the team picker's theme.

So let us toast to this software theme,
Where aspirations meld and dreams redeem,
In this world of bytes and pixels agleam,
Guided by the magic of the team picker's scheme.
